CS50's introduction to computer science and web programming courses took me through an applicationâ€™s life cycle of designing, developing ideas, building, testing and deploying. The best aspects of programming I think are problem-solving and technical creativity. Teaching for the past 6 years involved creativity when delivering new material and analysing information to evaluate teaching styles. I am hardworking and a fast learner; in the last few months I have learnt Python, JavaScript and various tools and frameworks. I am passionate about this career change so I am developing and learning new skills everyday. I will also bring excellent interpersonal and communication skills to my new career as a developer."
